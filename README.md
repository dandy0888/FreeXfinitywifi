##### WARNING: Doing this can get your account deleted I assume; since my account has been deleted.
##### It also seems they fixed it so now only the account gets a free hour pass, not each device of an account.
##### But don't worry my peasants! You can still enjoy free hour passes *hypothetically* by making an XFINITY ID each time and entering a random first and last name, a random email with a domain that doesn't exist, and a random security Q&A + password and it will provide you a free pass... hypothetically of course ;)

A shell script that changes your MAC ID so you can reuse free &quot;xfinitywifi&quot; 1 hour complimentary passes forever.

Requires your DNS to be set to 75.75.75.75 (Xfinity&#39;s DNS) so xfinitywifi can redirect you to the login page.
 Also requires macchanger to be installed for changing your MAC address.

- [x] Create a functional script
  
- [ ] Implement cron stuff so it runs once an hour
  
- [ ] Automate some browser stuff

PS: From my experience Xfinity heavily throttles "xfinitywifi" starting at 10:30PM until some time in the morning due to lower amount of people using it.

## Donating:
Do you appreciate this 12 line shell script that took me 5 minutes? Do you like to waste money? If so send me some bitcoin at: bc1qzt9yrh7synwd9rep43avwvudl8q09s8ehj0j0r
